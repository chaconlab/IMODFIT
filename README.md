Flexible fitting in internal coordinates with a reduced number of normal modes provides a natural way to alleviate overfitting distortions, such as poor resolution, map defects (e.g., scale inaccuracies, missing densities, resolution anisotropy), or even partial correspondence between the map and the atomic structure.</p>
