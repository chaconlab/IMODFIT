###############################################

The last stable version of iMODFIT (v1.44) is released with
other EM tools.


-------------------------------------------------------
iMODFIT (Internal coordinates normal MODe based FITing)
-------------------------------------------------------

We provide 64-bit LINUX statically linked executables generated with GNU
compilers to minimize library dependence problems. Dynamic linking was used 
for the faster Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) version.

> Programs provided
-------------------
imodfit           v1.51 --> Flexible fitting tool.
pdb2vol           v1.01 --> Simulated maps generation from PDB files.
rmsd              v1.04 --> Optimal atomic structures alignment (RMSD min.). 
pdbtool           v1.01 --> Atomic structures manipulation tool.

*All the programs show a basic help text using the --help option.

> Binaries releases
-------------------

Pre-compiled binaries are available in the corresponding bin/ directory. You 
can choose the appropriate release for your system:

 [Program]        Compiler    Libraries              Linkage
 -----------------------------------------------------------
*<TOOL>           Intel icpc  -                       static
 <TOOL>_gcc       GNU gcc     -                       static
*<TOOL>_mkl       Intel icpc  MKL                    dynamic

* Intel compiled binaries are the fastest alternatives. 
<TOOL> corresponds to the name of the program.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This software release has been compiled with 64-bit Intel "icpc"
(v. 19.0.2.187) and GNU "gcc" (7.3.0).

Statically linked executables are ready-to-use (nothing else required).

The following libraries may be required only to run the pre-compiled binaries 
of the Intel MKL release:

- Intel's C++ Compiler and Math Kernel Library - Current tested icpc version
19.0.2.187 (gcc version 7.3.0 compatibility).

Please, download and install the Intel C++ Compiler and Math Kernel Library:
  "Intel C++ Parallel Studio XE 2019 update-2 for Linux" (current tested 
  version is 19.0.2.187)

Newer Intel MKL versions should work as well.

Intel C++ Compiler and MKL libraires can be obtained for from Intel's web site:

iMODFIT IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------

The main improvements of v1.51 with respect to the previous (v1.44) are:

- Integration with Chimera's plug-in.
- Minor bugs removed.

The main improvements with respect to older versions are:

- Improved stability for very big and/or symmetrical macromolecular complexes.
- Improved speed thanks to our new parallel band-Krylov eigensolver:
 Aliaga JI, Alonso P, Badia JM, Chacon P, Davidovic D, Lopez-Blanco JR, and Quintana-Orti ES
 (2016). A fast band-Krylov eigensolver for macromolecular functional motion simulation on
 multicore architectures and graphics processors. Journal of Computational 
 Physics 309:314-323.
- Improved default parameters.
- Minor bugs removed.

TUTORIAL
--------

We encourage you to visit our web site and follow the tutorials:

  http://chaconlab.org/methods/fitting/imodfit/imodfit-tuto

*Some files to be used in the tutorial can be found in the imodfit_test/ 
directory.

iMODFIT EXAMPLE
---------------

We have included a simple test case in the imodfit_test/ subdirectory. 

The basic flexible fitting procedure is very simple. Please, just copy and 
paste the following commands in your terminal:

 Go to the test directory
  $ cd imodfit_test

 Perform the basic flexible fitting with a 10A target map
  $ ../bin/imodfit_mkl 1sx4A.pdb 1oel.ccp4 10 0 -t
 
 Check iMODFIT performance by directly visualizing the fitting movie
 (imodfit_movie.pdb) in your favorite viewer (VMD works fine). 
 
 Alternatively, compute the C-alpha RMSD between the fitted model and the PDB
 employed to simulate the target map:
  $ ../bin/rmsd imodfit_fitted.pdb 1oel.pdb -c 

 The final C-alpha RMSD is just 1.3752 A (1.2098 A after optimal alignment).
 
 You can try the flexible fitting in the opposite direction:
  $ ../bin/imodfit_mkl 1sx4A.pdb 1oel.ccp4 10 0 -t
 
The complete test takes around 13/8 minutes for gcc/intel binaries using an
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 950 running at 3.07GHz.
